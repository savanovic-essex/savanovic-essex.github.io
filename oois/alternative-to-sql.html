					<h2>Alternatives to SQL</h2>
				</header>
				<h4>Initial post</h4>
				<p>
					Over the last decade, there has been an increase in demand for applications which must deal with vast quantities of unstructured data. To meet demand, there is a significant trend toward more relaxed databases in the form of NoSQL databases (Alotaibi & Pardede, 2019). NoSQL databases use many data models to access and manage data, and their best feature is that most of them are open-source. These databases are primarily intended for applications that demand significant data volumes, low latency, and flexible data models obtained by loosening specific classic databases' data consistency limitations.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are several NoSQL databases, the most popular ones being document databases, graph databases, key-value databases and wide-column databases. Each has specific benefits and is utilized based on the use case at hand.
				</p>
				<p>
					Document databases, which are sometimes referred to as document stores, serve best for storing partially structured data in a document format. Their popularity grew with the rise of JavaScript usage.
				</p>
				<p>
					Graph databases, also called graph stores, are similar to classical RDS in the sense that they store data in nodes akin to rows in relational databases.
				</p>
				<p>
					Key-value databases have basic data models that correlate a unique key with a value, which can be perfectly utilized in caching or managing limited sessions in apps.
				</p>
				<p>
					Like an RDBMS, wide-column stores use rows, columns, and tables to store data, but unlike relational system, the columns can vary from row to row in the same table in a wide-column store. The column names can also be changed as needed, which provides a level of schema flexibility that does not exist in an RDBMs (Datanami, 2021).

				<h4>Peer Response to Rachel Doherty</h4>
				<p>
					Hi Rachel, <br/>
					Thank you for a very insightful essay!
				</p>
				<p>
					The term "NoSQL" (short for "not just SQL") has recently come to refer to a broad spectrum of databases that lack the characteristics of traditional relational databases and are not frequently searched with SQL (structured query language).
				</p>
				<p>
					It is essentially a vast serialized object store that allows one to retrieve objects by ID. It generally lacks an organized schema and does not handle complex queries. It encourages denormalization and is built from the ground to be distributed (cloud-scale). As a result, the ACID criteria are no longer required. Any database may answer any query, and any write query can act on any database, ultimately propagating to other distributed servers. Any server may respond to any query thanks to the distributed paradigm. Behind the scenes, servers speak with one another at their own pace. The server that responds to one's query might not have the most up-to-date information. As you have mentioned, NoSQL databases have a great application with the social media platforms but are still not popular enough for the large majority of corporate entities.
