				<h4>Initial post</h4>
				<p>
					In the world of information systems, external dependencies play a major role in a system's stability and reliability. They come in all different shapes and sizes, e.g. APIs, connectivity providers, hardware vendors, etc. In some cases, such as quickly building an MVP, they might seem like the perfect solution because they usually offer a swift and seamless integration. On the other hand, the consumer has very little control over their stability, which can consequently lead to various problems. One such issue was experienced in my company a few years ago.

				<h4>Peer Response to Rachel Doherty</h4>
				<p>
					Hi Rachel, <br/>
					Thank you for a very insightful essay!
				</p>
				<p>
					The term "NoSQL" (short for "not just SQL") has recently come to refer to a broad spectrum of databases that lack the characteristics of traditional relational databases and are not frequently searched with SQL (structured query language).
				</p>
				<p>
					It is essentially a vast serialized object store that allows one to retrieve objects by ID. It generally lacks an organized schema and does not handle complex queries. It encourages denormalization and is built from the ground to be distributed (cloud-scale). As a result, the ACID criteria are no longer required. Any database may answer any query, and any write query can act on any database, ultimately propagating to other distributed servers. Any server may respond to any query thanks to the distributed paradigm. Behind the scenes, servers speak with one another at their own pace. The server that responds to one's query might not have the most up-to-date information. As you have mentioned, NoSQL databases have a great application with the social media platforms but are still not popular enough for the large majority of corporate entities.
