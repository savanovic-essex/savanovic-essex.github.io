				<h4>Emerging Technology and its Implications: Self-Driving Cars</h4>
				<p>
					Autonomous vehicle technology has achieved a greater milestone over the past five years due to artificial intelligence and technology advancements. Some of the global technology companies that bolster the growth of self-driving cars include Tesla, Apple Inc, Google, Lyft and Uber. Due to the high rate of advancement of autonomous vehicle technology, there are several emerging trends and impacts of automation. The popular trends across the industry include the growth of connected infrastructure and shared rides, public safety and collaboration and partnership.
				</p>
				<p>
					Firstly, the development of self-driving cars introduces the idea of connected infrastructure, which involves offering mobility as a service. The concept uses technology in the transport industry to offer people consumer-focused transportation services by allowing them to lease cars or share bikes and taxis heading in the same direction. For instance, New York introduced self-driving shuttles in 2019 to offer self-driven shared transportation services (Baccarella et al., 2020). As a result, the impacts of this trend include lessening congestion on the roads and reducing the need for more parking spaces. Road traffic is among the major problem in busy cities and regions worldwide. Therefore, self-driving technology in shared rides benefits people by improving traffic flow.
				</p>
				<p>
					Secondly, autonomous vehicle technology offers more public safety than human driven vehicles. The creation of reliable and artificial intelligence contributes significantly to the increased safety of self-driving cars (Menon et al., 2018). Furthermore, the improvement of network services to 5G allows for intercommunication between car owners and other vehicles on the road through AI, which is impossible for human drivers. Moreover, self-driving cars lack human errors such as sleeping while driving and non-adherence to traffic laws, leading to accidents. Consequently, the United States intends to adopt autonomous vehicle technology to reduce vehicle accidents and save more than a million lives in the next thirty years.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lastly, the vehicle automation industry has recently experienced collaboration and partnership from various key players in the sector. Since it is expensive to design, test and produce self-driving vehicles, many companies work together to minimize individual risks and quicken their projects. The trend of collaboration benefits the automotive industry by allowing firms with different strengths and capabilities to share resources that advance autonomous technology (Mierlo et al., 2021). For instance, Ford and Volkswagen, the biggest vehicle manufacturers worldwide, collaborated to combine resources to enhance autonomous vehicle industry growth. As a result, the joint venture allows ford to access Volkswagen's electric vehicle design technology. Such partnerships expedite the development of autonomous vehicle technology.
				</p>
				<p>
					In conclusion, the automotive industry is shifting towards the production of self-driving vehicles. The advancement in technology and artificial intelligence offers the opportunity for growth. Despite previous scepticism regarding the safety of autonomous vehicles, the improved technology ensures that the vehicles are less prone to accidents and are reliable at any time. Moreover, the introduction of customer focused transport services such as ride sharing facilities increases the societal acceptability of autonomous vehicles.
