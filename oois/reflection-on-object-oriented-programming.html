					<h2>Reflection on Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					Object-oriented modelling and analysis aim to make it easier to create systems that can adapt quickly to changing business conditions. Object-oriented systems designing processes are explained in detail, along with the key differences between it and the SDLC's more systematic approach and when it is most suited to utilize it. It's widely believed that object-oriented methods perform best when dealing with complex information systems that need to be constantly maintained, adjusted, and redesigned. Object-oriented techniques use unified modelling language (UML) to break down an entire system into its constituent use case models. On the other hand, the traditional programming language doesn't examine the system as a whole, and Object-oriented programming does (Lokare et al., 2018). Each item is a digital depiction of an actual thing or occurrence in the real world. Customers, goods, orders, and so on are examples of objects. Reusability and maintainability are maximized by using classes to represent and organize objects. Each object in a class has the same set of characteristics and actions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Similar to the SDLC, the stages of the UML lifecycle are defined. Due to these two modelling approaches' strict and meticulous nature, they take place at a slower and more methodical pace than agile sculpting. Phases of the analyst's work include identifying problems, gathering data to analyze them, and presenting their findings. First, the analyst determines the players and the significant events they launched. You can see the usual sequence of activities in the system using a use case diagram. This is done by writing out a use case narrative that details the generally taken actions. Analysts will then create Activity Diagrams to show all of the use case's important actions. In addition, for each application case, the analyst will draw a flow chart to depict the order in which activities occur and when.
				</p>
				<p>
					Developing class diagrams is a necessary step in the analytical process. The nouns in these examples are things that may become classes. Every vehicle, for example, is an item that shares certain features with other automobiles, and all of these people make up a class. Drawing state chart diagrams is the last step in the analytical process. To create state chart diagrams, case diagrams are employed. These diagrams aid in comprehending more complicated processes that sequence diagrams adequately represent. The iterative approach of UML modelling proceeds thanks to the state chart diagrams, which are highly helpful in changing class diagrams. Analysts may then modify UML diagrams to begin system design. The finalization of the requirements follows this.
				</p>
				<p>
					The diagrams created in the preceding phase of system design must be modified as part of altering the current system. Classes, properties, and methods may be derived using these diagrams (methods are simply operations). Each class's characteristics, methods, and descriptions will need to be documented in class specifications, which the analyst will create. A full explanation of the internal functioning of the method will be included in the method specifications, as will input and output requirements (Ibrahim et al., 1992). Finally, the system has been designed and is well-known. This, of course, means that UML is a modeller's tool. Analysts can generate beautiful simulations, but there's little purpose in constructing models if the infrastructure isn't established. The importance of documentation cannot be overstated. Your final production process will be more robust and efficient if you supply the design team with as much information as possible through documents and UML diagrams.
				</p>
				<p>
					This approach, known as the spiral, is often used in object-oriented techniques and emphasizes short, rapid development iterations. A limited portion of the system is subjected to analysis, generally beginning with a slightly elevated item or one that carries the most risk. Then comes the fun part: conceptualization and design. The cycle is continued until the job is finished, including analysis, design, and some execution for the following step. An effective tool for analyzing and designing complex systems is UML, which may considerably enhance the value of your work. Many forethoughts and diagramming are required in both the SDLC and the object-oriented techniques. The object-oriented and agile approaches both allow for constructing individual subsystems until the entire system is complete. Data flow is an essential consideration in both the agile and SDLC methodologies.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even though object-oriented programming has been around for a while, it is hard to recall a period when it was employed in software development. In contrast to the conventional top-down programming approach, object-oriented programming was a game-changer when it first arrived in the 1980s. OOP is now widely used in software development.
					I believe that the biggest impact the OOP will have on me, and my personal development is in the way I think of solving complex system problems. The best part of object-oriented programming is that it does not have to be applied to code only but can rather be thought of as a methodology in organization. For example, one can apply this methodology in creating a clean folder structure for any type of a project, especially code projects. Up until this module, I was mostly working with JavaScript and its frameworks, which are not type-strict and are purely functional, unlike Python which can adapt to OOP methodology on its own. Having obtained more in-depth knowledge in this topic, I feel more comfortable moving towards backend software development, and RESTful APIs as a next step. I find the Django framework an optimal starting point for my path towards becoming a genuine system architect. To summarize, I learned a new method of thinking and problem solving, as well as improved my coding skills in Python and SQL.
