					<h2>Information System Failure</h2>
				</header>
				<h4>Initial post</h4>
				<p>
					In the world of information systems, external dependencies play a major role in a system's stability and reliability. They come in all different shapes and sizes, e.g. APIs, connectivity providers, hardware vendors, etc. In some cases, such as quickly building an MVP, they might seem like the perfect solution because they usually offer a swift and seamless integration. On the other hand, the consumer has very little control over their stability, which can consequently lead to various problems. One such issue was experienced in my company a few years ago.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the early stages of the startup company where I work, an external entity built and deployed our product's backend. The servers were located in their data centre, in a rather remote part of Austria. Unfortunately for them, my company and many other companies they serve, their internet went down, due to the main cable breaking. This outage rendered our product unusable, which additionally caused our app's rating to plummet.
				</p>
				<p>
					I believe this to be a perfect example of how an external dependency can just about ruin one's product and reputation.
				</p>
				<p>
					When analysing this incident, one can put the blame on all parties, even though the root cause, or rather issue was on the internet provider. Both my company and the company that was serving our backend were supposed to have a backup strategy for such cases, but they did not.
				</p>
				<p>
					Commonly, our product's backend was moved to a more secure cloud server with a rather large platform provider and since then no similar problems occurred.
				</p>

				<h4>Peer Response to Grzegorz Pikus</h4>
				<p>
					In today's age, testing has become a quintessential part of software development as a consequence of more complex and potentially malfunctioning applications. There are various types of software tests, but the most common ones used at the present time are unit tests, integration tests and load tests. Some software developers even go a step further by implementing a new methodology of development called "test-driven development". In it, they write their code according to the prewritten tests.
				</p>
				<p>
					Karabasevic et al. (2018) argue that "software errors can cause huge pecuniary damages, as well as non-material losses (reputation, honour ...) so they must be eliminated as early as possible." As a software developer myself, I could not agree more with the statement above. By implementing software testing at early stages, maintaining stability during scaling can almost be guaranteed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Companies did not widely implement software testing in the late 20th century. Still, its origins do go back to the 1950s, so one would expect an agency such as the ESA to have had safety and security measurements implemented. Unfortunately, that was not the case.
					<br /><br />
					In this accident, we see how big of an impact a minor change, or rather an oversight, can have on the end product.
					<br /><br />
					In my opinion, even a simple unit test could have helped avoid such a catastrophe.

				<h4>Peer Response to Andrea Paolo Gussoni</h4>
				<p>
					Hi Andrea, <br/>
					Thank you for your post about Cloudbleed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Such examples of potential exploits teach us that our data is never truly safe. In this particular incident, pure luck saved users' data from being exploited. Accessing tokens and other data connected to authorization headers allows hackers to hijack sessions on various websites easily.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many large corporations or government entities use external providers for their digital infrastructure, and sometimes their DevOps engineers fail to protect their data adequately. One such incident happened in September of 2017 to Accenture, when their data, stored on Amazon S3 storage, was leaked. The incident exposed internal Accenture private keys, secret API data, and other information, a gift for attackers that want to target the firm or its clients (Security Affairs, 2017). These problems usually occur when configuration files are incomplete or poorly configured.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to tackle such problems, additional care needs to be taken during the QA process. Additionally, end-to-end testing and integration tests have to be brought into action. QA should also be able to detect problems early and report them proactively. To achieve this, they need to set up monitoring of the Production environment to be able to expose bugs before they cause a failure (Software Testing Help, n.d.).

				<h4>Summary Post</h4>
				<p>
					External dependencies have played a significant role in system reliability and stability in information communication systems. These systems come in different sizes and shapes, such as hardware vendors, connection providers and other information communication firms. In some other cases, such as quickly building a minimum viable product, they seem to be the perfect solution because they can provide a seamless society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication integrations. Seemingly, the consumer has very little control over stability, which would lead to various problems (Richer, 2019). One such issue was experienced in a basketball team in Germany that was relegated to a lower division because of the windows update.
				</p>
				<p>
					On 13 March 2015, the Paderborn Baskets, a second-division German Basketball team, was placed in a lower division because of starting a game seventeen minutes late because of the windows update to the board laptop (Flanagan, 2015). One of such issues I also experienced in my company some few years ago. This incident occurred in a remote part of Austria. In the early stages of the company where I worked, an external entity was built and deployed on our backend products, and these serves were located in a central data center; unfortunately, for these external entities, my own company and other companies they served, their internet connection went down due to primary cable breaking, this outage from the primary serves rendered my product and other company's products unstable. Usually, there are fundamental causes of cable failures and breaking that might have caused the loss of the internet, such as fatigue and shield in the flex area.
				</p>
				<p>
					The above examples have shown how external dependencies would kill one's product and reputation. When analyzing such incidences, we must consider all the parties involved, even though the root cause was on the internet provider.
