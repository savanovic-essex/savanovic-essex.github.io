					<h2>Information System Failure</h2>
				</header>
				<h4>Initial post</h4>
				<p>
					In the world of information systems, external dependencies play a major role in a system's stability and reliability. They come in all different shapes and sizes, e.g. APIs, connectivity providers, hardware vendors, etc. In some cases, such as quickly building an MVP, they might seem like the perfect solution because they usually offer a swift and seamless integration. On the other hand, the consumer has very little control over their stability, which can consequently lead to various problems. One such issue was experienced in my company a few years ago.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the early stages of the startup company where I work, an external entity built and deployed our product's backend. The servers were located in their data centre, in a rather remote part of Austria. Unfortunately for them, my company and many other companies they serve, their internet went down, due to the main cable breaking. This outage rendered our product unusable, which additionally caused our app's rating to plummet.
				</p>
				<p>
					I believe this to be a perfect example of how an external dependency can just about ruin one's product and reputation.
				</p>
				<p>
					When analysing this incident, one can put the blame on all parties, even though the root cause, or rather issue was on the internet provider. Both my company and the company that was serving our backend were supposed to have a backup strategy for such cases, but they did not.
				</p>
				<p>
					Commonly, our product's backend was moved to a more secure cloud server with a rather large platform provider and since then no similar problems occurred.
				</p>

				<h4>Peer Response to Grzegorz Pikus</h4>
				<p>
					In today's age, testing has become a quintessential part of software development as a consequence of more complex and potentially malfunctioning applications. There are various types of software tests, but the most common ones used at the present time are unit tests, integration tests and load tests. Some software developers even go a step further by implementing a new methodology of development called "test-driven development". In it, they write their code according to the prewritten tests.
				</p>
				<p>
					Karabasevic et al. (2018) argue that "software errors can cause huge pecuniary damages, as well as non-material losses (reputation, honour ...) so they must be eliminated as early as possible." As a software developer myself, I could not agree more with the statement above. By implementing software testing at early stages, maintaining stability during scaling can almost be guaranteed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Companies did not widely implement software testing in the late 20th century. Still, its origins do go back to the 1950s, so one would expect an agency such as the ESA to have had safety and security measurements implemented. Unfortunately, that was not the case.
					<br /><br />
					In this accident, we see how big of an impact a minor change, or rather an oversight, can have on the end product.
					<br /><br />
					In my opinion, even a simple unit test could have helped avoid such a catastrophe.
