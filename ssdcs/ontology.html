					<h2>What is an ontology?</h2>
				</header>
				<h4>Ontology</h4>
				<p>
					Ontology can be described in various ways but is majorly associated with studying existence. First, ontology is described as a set of representational primitives used to model the domain of discourse. Representational primitives are classes, relationships, and attributes. Second, ontology can be associated with a data model responsible for representing a group of concepts found in a particular domain and how those concepts relate to each other. For instance, in AI, biomedical informatics, software engineering, and information architecture, ontology is described as a knowledge representation of the global. Besides, ontologies in computer science primarily describe individuals, classes like collections and sets, attributes properties such as parameters of substances, events like variations of relations, and relations; the relationship between objects.
				</p>
				<p>
					Arnaut et al. (2010) have presented a lot of facts about ontology. Ontologies are utilized in the organization of services in repositories per the expectations of ontology web service language and web service modelling ontology. Besides, ontologies are associated with restrictions such as being utilized on routine only and dealing with web service technology only when implementing services. An ontology for service-oriented architecture seems to be the best; it was formed due to the literature and the existing ontologies. The ontology of SOA was associated with the services of substantial multinational firms (Arnaut et al.).
				</p>
				<p>
					Similarly, ontologies are utilized to group services that support recovery and research in the SOA repository. Besides, ontologies are also essential for forming solutions to some complex problems. Furthermore, ontologies offer terms and knowledge utilized in other WSMO elements giving a chance to describe relevant aspects associated with a particular domain.
