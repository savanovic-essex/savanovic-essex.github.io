				<h4>Cryptography case study: TrueCrypt</h4>
				<p>
					The cryptanalysis provided approves the assumption that TrueCrypt is not secure. Even though the project had been developed for a long time and updated in line with the most recent security features, a security audit on the software revealed some critical bugs. Most of these provided no backdoors and therefore could not be used by attackers to compromise an end-user machine. However, that would allow the attacker to install spyware on the host machine or capture the keystrokes. As a result, the attacker could quickly grab the encryption key and use it to access the host computer's disk drive.
				</p>
				<p>
					These loopholes are what the TrueCrypt developers refer to, leading to their recommendation to TrueCrypt users to seek alternative disk encryption software such as BitLocker (TrueCrypt, 2014). Thus, the analysis is fully validated and worth implementing by any security-conscious individual.
				</p>
				<p>
					TrueCrypt has been one of the best disk encryption software in the market. Therefore, it stands out as the best secure storage environment that would still have been useful even in the current times. However, its use has become limited, primarily due to a lack of updates. Therefore, its use calls for an update on the Windows build environment, which, unfortunately, depends on outdated build tools and software packages that are now hard to come by (Junestam & Guigo, 2014).
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite the changes, I would suggest that TrueCrypt supporters choose VeraCrypt, a build from TrueCrypt's source code with all the security features fully updated. It is also under active development, placing it at the forefront whenever disk encryption software and secure storage environments are considered. Using such tools, however, should be accompanied by a lot of caution, as most attackers are on the lookout and are constantly researching and developing exploits.
