          <h2>Debate: Microservices and Microkernels</h2>
        </header>
        <h4>Individual Forum Post</h4>
        <p>
          I agree that the future of the discussion is microservices and microkernels. I believe Linus made some excellent arguments in the debate about monolithic kernels. Monolithic kernels undoubtedly benefited from some of the lessons learnt from research on microkernel technology. Occasionally, Microsoft would assert that the Win32 kernel utilized a microkernel architecture. It seems a bit of a stretch when looking at certain textbook microkernels, but some technical justification supports the claims.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first justification demonstrates that reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architectures will rule the market, and x86 technologies will become obsolete. RISC leads the CPU market if you step back from computers and servers. "There are more ARM processors than x86 processors in use, more ARM processors are sold than x86 processors," and there is a more significant total processing capacity for the ARM than for x86 (Fritzsch et al., 2019). According to the debate, one ARM vendor—right, that's Apple—might outsell all x86 suppliers put together. Only the computer and server markets are dominated by x86. This will probably be the case for a while, as long as Linux is the server platform of choice and Windows is the preferred desktop operating system.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second justification is that open source failed in the debate. In fixed function products, where the ability to personalize the product is not a component of the consumer value proposition, more computation is accomplished for the same amount of money (DiBona et al., 1999). Ironically, open source also thrived in fixed-function devices, but manufacturers value the advantages more than consumers. However, as the internet and cloud computing has developed, desktop computing has grown more specialized (mostly running a browser), "with the other services operating" in the cloud. Open source has lost most in the general-purpose computer space.

          Understanding the difference between microservices and monolithic systems can be made easier by comparing it to a real business example. In this example, business decisions can be all signed by the highest order director or by one of the department directors. The second structure is probably what is embraced nowadays, because of its reusability and adaptability to change granted by easier management and communication inside smaller divisions/ departments. On the other hand, the first structure with one director might have the advantage of faster delivery of client requests due to the lower number of communications necessary to accomplish a task compared to multiple communications in the multi-division structure. However, scalability is an issue here; increasing the number of clients is tied to increasing the overall available resources compared to only increasing every unit's resources by a small capacity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Getting now the bridge to operating systems and databases. Let’s examine the following examples. The first one is handling Big Data. The best solution for that is probably a decentralized approach because it makes scaling up requests so easy. The second example is coding languages; modules and classes are used to break up things into more manageable components.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main perspective of the analysis here is focused on functionality aspects. However, security is an essential part too. Let's assume that error tracking would be much easier in using microkernels, which is an argument for the general use of the microsystems (Biggs et al., 2018). Nevertheless, security does not only depend on error detection and tracking, but also on access control mechanisms and much more. In that respect, it seems there is still a lot of research that needs to be done to guarantee the security of microservices applications. One clear example of this necessity is the Mobile Edge Computing Technologies (Roman et al., 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
          The shift toward cloud computing and related technologies has been obvious due to the many advantages it can offer (Hashem et al., 2015; Hassani & Silva, 2015). Along that shift, containerized microservices have been supportive due to the lightweight nature that offers virtualization at the operating system level to encapsulate resources needed for a group of processes (Marcelo et al., 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
          Having said that, microservices may not be the solution to every problem. System architects need to carefully analyze business processes and how they are expected to go in the future. If the use of microservices is expected to simplify the design and bring the aforementioned advantages, then the choice is well argued and well-chosen (Bucchiarone et al., 2018; Biggs et al., 2018; Tapia et al., 2020; Newman & Fowler, 2020). Otherwise using a monolithic approach may be more suitable (Newman & Fowler, 2020).
