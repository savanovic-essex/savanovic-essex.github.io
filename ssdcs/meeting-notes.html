        <h4>Meeting minutes</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Team meeting 27.06.22: minutes & actions</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>
              We discussed which programming language / app development platform to use:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Flask and Python were preferred, based on group members’ experience (Django could be possible)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Djordje suggested using Firebase as the platform – specifically the Cloud Firestore – as a simple solution to build a database and connect frontend
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Mohammed had made a summary of the brief to break down the requirements clearly:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  We discussed choosing the domain and the assessing domain-specific requirements – Djordje mentioned that it was possible to use Heroku.com or AWS to assess the requirements
                </li>
                <li>
                  We collectively decided that the Dutch Police Internet Forensics domain was the most appropriate for the project
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              To keep track of meeting progress, Djordje suggested we start a jira workspace, in a similar approach to SCRUM
            </li>
            <li>
              We collectively decided we need to clarify what is expected in terms of use of programming languages/ concurrent events / the mircoservice application version
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>

          <strong>Team meeting 04.07.22: minutes & actions</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Djordje updated us on the tools that we will be using for the application. These are:
              <ul>
                <li>Front end : Reactjs</li>
                <li>Databases: Firebase Realtime except for documents and images will be saved to Firebase cloud.</li>
                <li>Event monitoring :Firebase events</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Djordje mentioned that we received a positive feedback form Dr. peoples regarding how are we going to implement the application.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We discussed that Firebase products will be able to handle most of the application requirements natively including user registration, authentication, storage.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We agreed that data security should be implemented as the following:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Using HTTPs for data transmission.</li>
                    <li>Encrypting sensitive data that will be identified at the design stage.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  We discussed that meeting the GDPR requirements may not be necessary as this application will be for police internal use. However, this will be verified once the application specifications are finalized.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Djordje gave us an update about his search for the encryption methods available for the Firebase database. He will continue his search to find a way to decrypt the data.
            </li>
            <li>
              We worked on a sitemap for the web application using https://app.diagrams.net.
            </li>
            <li>
              We agreed on the user types to be as the following:
              <ul>
                <li>Super admin/admin be responsible for adding the cyber specialists to the system internally without a registration form.</li>
                <li>Cyber specialists will be responsible for adding new reports or working on publicly submitted reports.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Djordje shared a link on how to build an app using ReactJS and Firebase Realtime Database.

          <ol>
            <li>
              Djordje informed us about the data encryption solution and testing framework that he found suitable for our project:
              <ul>
                <li>Encryption : Crypto JS library that uses AES.</li>
                <li>Testing: Jest framework.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            </li>
            <li>
              We also reviewed the design document draft that we will send to Dr. Peoples for approval.
