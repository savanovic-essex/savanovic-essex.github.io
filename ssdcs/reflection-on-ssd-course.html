        <h4>Reflection on the Secure Software Development Course</h4>
        <p>
          According to Daud, M.I. (2010), most organisations process their confidential information using software systems via the internet. Hackers can exploit a minor software bug and steal confidential data. Based on the sentiment above, one can conclude that security is a significant factor in software development. Even though I consider myself a somewhat seasoned software developer, I never paid too much attention to the security aspect of my code. This is, I believe, due to the fact that my field of work is focused on the front-end, primarily mobile and some web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          After going through the first three units of the Secure Software Development course, I learned that I know very little about security in app development. One of the indicators for this realisation was that I had never even heard of the OWASP standard, which was an eye-opening revelation for me, and I still had much to learn at that point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to many individual formative assignments in the Secure Software Development course, I found myself trying to keep up with progress. However, I focused on the two group assignments, seeing them as more important and time-consuming. This decision, in my opinion, was both correct and incorrect. Firstly, it was right to focus on writing as much code as possible because I caught a bad case of COVID and was incapacitated for almost two weeks in the middle of the course. Secondly, it was incorrect because I was late on most formative assignments; as mentioned above, there were many.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the course progressed, I could not help but focus on the OWASP standard, which was very helpful when my group had to create a design document for our application and develop it. My group peers and I mainly focused on the A01-2021 and A07-2021 categories of the OWASP standard, which are Broken Access Control and Identification and Authentication Failures, respectively (OWASP, 2021).
        </p>
        <p>
          When my group finalised the design document for the first assignment, we realised that it was almost impossible to develop everything on the list from the ground up. The plan for the application was quite challenging, and it was apparent that we needed help from the outside. Luckily for me and ultimately my group, I had experience with Firebase products, and we decided to use them for some parts of our application. This example of my previous vocational knowledge helping us in the university is somewhat humorous because the university course helped me learn to become a better software developer in my company.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the design document, we implemented all requirements and tried to keep the functionalities and security at the highest level. This was achieved by developing a good concept of security layers and help from Firebase products, which provided us with authentication and authorisation mechanisms. The inspiration for our solution came from real life, and we thought of an onion, which has many layers protecting its core and applied the same logic to the NCSC web application. In the end, our solution proved worthy, and my group received a high score and positive feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I started the Secure Software Development course, I did not know what to expect. Now that I am at the end of the module, I see how important it is for my academic and vocational knowledge. I can appreciate the significance of all exercises and, in particular, the group assignments. This course made me focus more on details than before and helped me work thoroughly to achieve the best result possible. Apart from that, it assisted me in improving my social skills by working in a group and being responsible to my team peers. We did not only learn about security in software but also how to be punctual, detail-oriented and accountable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The security aspect of code is the most significant enhancement in my personal development due to the Secure Software Development module. Not only will I pay more attention to security, but I will also be able to move in a different direction in my career. One piece of the puzzle that was always missing in my IT proficiency was system architecture. Since my focus was always on the front-end part of software development, I never had a chance to learn how to design a system from all aspects concerning it. The group project was a perfect opportunity for me to learn by building an exciting web application in a great group setting.

          I regret avoiding developing the app in Python, i.e. the Flask framework, even though Python is used in only 1.4% of all server-side rendering applications, according to w3techs.com (n.d.). This was a missed opportunity for me to extend my knowledge of Python. However, due to the time restrictions, we decided to take a safer route and implement everything we promised in the design document. My knowledge in Javascript, i.e. React.js, Firebase products and system architecture, has increased immensely; for that, I am thankful and proud.I regret avoiding developing the app in Python, i.e. the Flask framework, even though Python is used in only 1.4% of all server-side rendering applications, according to w3techs.com (n.d.).

        <p>
          Ultimately, the Secure Software Development course has proved to be one of the most challenging and time-consuming courses I have ever taken. Nevertheless, it is also a course which brought me the most practical and academic knowledge. One wish is to have more time for individual formative assignments, as I could not put enough effort into them due to the time constraint.
        </p>
        <p>
          I experienced many obstacles that made me a better student and programmer. Many opportunities were taken, and some were lost, but in the end, I am happy with my progress and believe I can take on the following courses with a firm belief in my IT comprehension.
