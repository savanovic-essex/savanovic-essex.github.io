					Monitoring can help organizations identify and prevent cyber security attacks within their networks. By tracking user activity and identifying anomalous behaviour, organizations can quickly detect and respond to potential threats (Iso.org, 2019). Additionally, organizations can protect themselves from insider threats by monitoring employee access to sensitive data.
				</p>
				<p>
					A policy can help overcome cyber security attacks by ensuring all employees have up-to-date training on cyber security best practices. This can help employees know the dangers of clicking on malicious links or opening attachments from unknown sources. Another way that policy can help overcome cyber security attacks is by mandating two-factor authentication for all sensitive data and systems. This provides another layer of protection by having users give a password and a second factor, for example, an access code, to obtain access.
				</p>
				<p>
					A process can assist in combating cyber security attacks by understanding the types of operations within their organization. Once they have identified these operations, they can begin to map out how these operations interact. This mapping approach will help businesses identify potential vulnerabilities and find ways to address them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Security implementation standards can help overcome cyber security attacks in several ways. First, by mandating specific security measures, organizations can make it more difficult for attackers to access sensitive information. Second, by requiring documentation and audits of security procedures, organizations can ensure that their systems are up to date and that any potential weaknesses are identified and addressed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Information security can help organizations to protect themselves against cyber security by implementing strong access control measures (Iso.org, 2019). Organizations can ensure that only authorized individuals can access sensitive information and systems. Secondly, by encrypting data and using other security technologies, organizations can make it much more difficult for attackers to obtain and use sensitive information.
