					<h2>Collaborative Discussion 1: Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct</h2>
				</header>
				<h4>Peer response to Elizabeth Cook</h4>
				<p>
					Addressing abusive workplace behaviour necessitates considering organizational implementation of codes of ethics, bystander intervention, and alternative measures to combat discrimination. Effective enforcement of codes of ethics, such as training and reporting mechanisms, can foster a culture of accountability (DuBois et al., 2018). Bystander intervention plays a crucial role in preventing workplace abuse (Nelson & Simmons, 2003), with organizations needing to empower employees to report incidents and intervene when necessary.
				</p>
				<p>
					Learning from similar cases involving code violations (Johnson, 2018) can inform future prevention strategies and organizational changes. Additionally, implementing alternative measures, such as unconscious bias training and inclusive hiring practices, can create a more supportive work environment (Bilimoria & Liang, 2012). By addressing these critical questions and seeking innovative solutions, organizations can better promote ethical conduct and inclusivity.
				</p>
				<p>
					Legally, autonomous weapons development may fall under international humanitarian law (IHL) and jurisdictional restrictions. The Martens Clause, a fundamental IHL principle, mandates that emerging technologies adhere to principles of humanity and dictates of public conscience (ICRC, n.d.). Computing professionals must consider these legal aspects.

				<h4>Peer response to Alberto Rossotto</h4>
				<p>
					Dear Alberto,
					<br />
					thank you for your insightful essay!
					<br />
					Compared to the Corazón case, a similar instance occurred with St. Jude Medical's implantable cardiac devices, where vulnerabilities were discovered, potentially allowing unauthorized access and control of the devices (CISA, 2017). In both cases, medical device manufacturers developed implantable devices with wireless connections, and vulnerabilities were identified related to the security of these connections.
				</p>
				<p>
					Similarities and differences can be observed when evaluating these cases against the BCS Code of Conduct (BCS, 2020) and the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (ACM, 2018). Both companies respected the public interest, focusing on patient well-being and equal access to I.T. benefits. They also demonstrated professional competence, integrity, and duty to the profession by engaging with security researchers and promoting participation through bug bounty programs.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, in response to the vulnerabilities, the companies differed in their approach. St. Jude Medical promptly worked with the FDA and the security researchers to address the issues, while Corazón ignored the vulnerability after a cost-benefit analysis. This decision by Corazón raises concerns regarding their adherence to the ACM Code of Ethics, precisely the principle of "avoiding harm" (ACM, 2018).
				</p>
				<p>
					Although Corazón's choice to prioritize patient safety over cybersecurity is understandable, as Williams & Woodward (2015) supported it, it still poses risks to the integrity of the device's data.
				</p>
				<p>
					Comparatively, St. Jude Medical's response aligns more closely with the BCS Code of Conduct and the ACM Code of Ethics, as they took steps to mitigate potential harm.
				</p>
				<p>
					In conclusion, while Corazón's decision can be justified to some extent, it is essential for medical device manufacturers to continuously evaluate and address security vulnerabilities to align with the ethical principles outlined in the BCS and ACM codes.

				<h4>Literature Review and Research Proposal OutlinesPage</h4>
				<p>
					For the literature review on "App Development for Emergency Services," I think it could be interesting to explore the evolution and impact of such apps on emergency response times and efficiency. Looking at a range of apps already being used in the field, their features, and real-world impact could provide a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape. The challenges associated with the implementation and security of these apps, user acceptance, and the potential ethical implications should be a pivotal part of the discussion. It would be beneficial to conclude with an exploration of the future of app development in this context, such as the integration of AI, real-time tracking, or predictive analysis capabilities.
				</p>
				<p>
					When it comes to the research proposal, I believe a compelling topic could be the potential of app development to enhance the efficiency of emergency services, given the real-world significance of rapid response times. The proposal should outline the planned methodology for exploring this topic, the significance of the study in contributing to the broader field, and the approach to data analysis. It could also be beneficial to pre-emptively address potential challenges that might arise during the study, such as issues with data privacy or obtaining sufficient relevant data.
