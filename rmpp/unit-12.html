					<h2>Reflection on the Research Methods and Professional Practice module</h2>
				</header>
				<h4>Essay</h4>
				<p>
					Undertaking a comprehensive twelve-unit course exploring research methods and statistical analysis has been eye-opening and fulfilling but demanding. Every unit brought me closer to a deeper understanding of the subject matter while also providing me with new insights and strengthening my grasp of the fundamentals. Per the reflective framework suggested by Rolfe et al. (2001), I will reflect on my experiences, the knowledge I have gained, the challenges I have surmounted, and the resulting implications for my future endeavours.
				</p>
				<p>
					The course was systematic and thoughtfully structured, commencing with fundamental concepts like the scientific method and ethical issues in research (Unit 1), progressively advancing towards the complexities of project management (Unit 12). Each unit offered an opportunity to comprehend new concepts, rekindle and fortify prior knowledge, and identify areas demanding further refinement. I embarked on this journey with a baseline understanding of statistical analysis. However, the new perspectives acquired and the reinforced comprehension across the units resulted in a profound and multidimensional learning experience.
				</p>
				<p>
					The course commenced with exploring the importance of ethics in research in Unit 1. I had been aware of the significance of ethical considerations in upholding the credibility and integrity of any research endeavour (Resnik, 2015). However, the course's exploration of this concept nudged me to introspect and evaluate my professional practice and research activities through the lens of ethical considerations. This realisation reinforced my respect for ethical boundaries in research.
				</p>
				<p>
					The reinforcement of my statistical prowess occurred during Units 8 and 9, where the concepts of statistical analysis were revisited. Engaging with these units reignited my abilities in calculating measures of central tendency like mean, median, and average values of samples and conducting hypothesis testing. Garfield's (1995) assertion of the fundamental role of statistical knowledge in research gained a renewed significance during these units, emphasising the necessity of robust statistical analysis to maintain the validity of research findings.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second and third units of the Research Methods and Professional Practice module served as an invaluable foundation for my research skills. Through these units, I developed a keen ability to craft meaningful research inquiries and determine the most appropriate research methods to utilise. Experienced researchers understand the vital importance of the initial stages of research, as they greatly influence the final results of a study. Thanks to these units' exceptional guidance and resources, I refined my approach to research and gained a deeper understanding of the intricate processes involved. Overall, I emerged from these units feeling confident in my abilities to produce high-quality research that is both impactful and meaningful.
				</p>
				<p>
					The topics covered in Units 4 to 6 were highly enlightening and informative. The modules delved into the various methods of data collection commonly used in research and provided a comprehensive understanding of how to design effective and efficient questionnaires. The depth of knowledge that was imparted in these units was truly invaluable, and it helped me to hone my skills and improve my understanding of the importance of questionnaire design in research. The content covered in these modules will be of great use to me in my future studies and research endeavours.
				</p>
				<p>
					Upon completing Unit 10 on academic writing, I found myself struggling with a sense of anxiety regarding my ability to effectively communicate my thoughts and maintain a balanced approach in my writing. Despite the valuable insights and practical guidance provided by the course, I felt overwhelmed by the weight of academic expectations. Sword's (2012) observation that even seasoned academics can find academic writing daunting further reinforced the importance of ongoing practice and learning in this area.
				</p>
				<p>
					A discernible gap in my understanding was the intricate dynamics of AI technologies. This gap was highlighted due to the rising prominence of AI in data analysis (Davenport & Dyché, 2013). As AI technologies were not extensively covered in this course, this presents a learning curve that I must surmount in the future.
				</p>
				<p>
					The revelations and insights gleaned from this course have given me a well-rounded understanding of research methodologies and statistical analysis and highlighted specific areas where my skills require further development. To this end, I am resolved to hone my academic writing skills and expand my understanding of AI technologies, which are integral to my professional growth. The concepts of project management and risk management, although touched upon in Unit 12, also merit further exploration due to their relevance in executing successful research projects (PMI, 2017). I am determined to delve deeper into these areas, focusing on risk and change management.
				</p>
				<p>
					Throughout this reflective journey, I have come to understand the vital importance of continuous learning and improvement in research methodologies and statistical analysis. The knowledge and skills gained from this course will help me grow professionally and equip me with the necessary tools to navigate the ever-changing research and statistical analysis fields. Looking back on my education and career, I have learned much about my strengths, achievements, and areas where I could improve. Upon reviewing the Professional Skills Matrix, I found that my technical skills are indispensable, but I need to work on my academic skills, particularly in analysing research papers critically. Additionally, I could benefit from assistance in communicating messages confidently and effectively. However, this realisation has taught me that improving oneself is an ongoing process, and I should strive to enhance all aspects of my life.
