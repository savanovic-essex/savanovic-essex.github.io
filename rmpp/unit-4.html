				<h4>Preparation</h4>
				<p>
					Ricardo should only independently release the information if he is responsible for determining access, and doing so could breach confidentiality and privacy rights. Requests for personal data must follow the appropriate channels and permissions, even in a research context (Moor, 1985).
				</p>
				<p>
					If Ricardo were responsible for granting access, he would have to balance the potential benefits of the research with the privacy rights of the individuals in the database. He would also need to ensure that Beth plans to obtain informed consent from the individuals she contacts and that she has procedures in place to protect their data (ACM, 2018).
					Furthermore, he would have to check if providing such information aligns with the organization's data privacy policy and the existing laws and regulations.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Records department would need to consider privacy laws and data protection policies, both internal and governmental. They would also need to assess Beth's credentials, the value of her research, her protocol for data protection, and the potential risks to the individuals involved (Spiekermann & Cranor, 2009). It would be more ethical to anonymize the data and let the Records department contact the individuals on Beth's behalf, inviting them to participate in the study.
				</p>
				<p>
					Beth could try to increase her sample size by seeking additional records from the database, assuming she is granted permission. Another option is to refine her study to complete it with a smaller sample. She could also reach out again to the individuals who did not respond, possibly with a follow-up communication explaining the importance of the study and the measures taken to protect their data. However, she should respect the decisions of those who actively denied permission and not assume that non-response equates to consent (Nissenbaum, 2009).
