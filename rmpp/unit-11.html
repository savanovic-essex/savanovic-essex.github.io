				<h4>Preparation & Reflection</h4>
				<p>
					Reflecting on my educational and professional journey, I have gained valuable insights into my skills, accomplishments, and areas for improvement. After reviewing the Professional Skills Matrix concerning my competencies, I discovered that my technical skills are vital. Still, my academic skills need improvement, particularly in critically analysing research papers. I also needed help with conveying messages effectively and confidently. However, this realisation has shown me that learning is a continuous process, and I need to focus on self-improvement in all areas of my life.
				</p>
				<p>
					Looking back, my technical skills were already solid, but my academic skills required some work. I initially struggled with expressing myself effectively and using proper referencing. However, I noticed a significant improvement as I progressed through various courses. This showed me that academic skills could be honed with dedicated effort and perseverance, which boosted my confidence.
				</p>
				<p>
					A SWOT analysis provided me with a detailed roadmap of my professional growth journey, highlighting areas that needed significant improvement and those that merely required minor adjustments. It also helped me identify the technical skills necessary for my capstone project, which enabled better project planning and execution.
				</p>
				<p>
					Out of all the courses I have taken, the module that had the most profound impact on my professional practice was the one that focused on academic and scientific writing. This module introduced me to literature reviews and evidence-based decision-making, enriching my thought process and teaching me to draw insights from literature reviews. This knowledge has allowed me to chart my work trajectory more effectively.
				</p>
				<p>
					In conclusion, this reflective exercise has reinforced the value of constant learning, helping me identify my strengths and areas for improvement. Armed with this knowledge, I am excited to refine my skills further and expand my academic and professional horizons.
