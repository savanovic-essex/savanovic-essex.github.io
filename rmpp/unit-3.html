					<h2>Collaborative Discussion 1: Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct</h2>
				</header>
				<h4>Summary Post</h4>
				<p>
					The development of autonomous active response weaponry presents significant ethical, legal, and social challenges. As outlined in the ACM Code of Ethics (2018) and the BCS Code of Conduct (2022), computing professionals must act in the public interest and assess the potential ramifications of their work. To ensure compliance, these professionals must maintain risk transparency, continuously learn, and adhere to legal and regulatory frameworks.
				</p>
				<p>
					In response to the initial essay, Demian raises the issue of implementing fines or regulatory oversight as punitive measures for entities creating autonomous weapon systems in the event of an onsite fatality. This inquiry highlights the necessity of establishing accountability in developing and deploying such technology.
				</p>
				<p>
					Elizabeth's response contends that although the ACM and BCS codes of conduct encourage IT professionals to prioritise public safety, they lack legal enforceability. The potential loss of human life from AI weaponry should be weighed against the number of lives that could be saved. For instance, if the AI system eliminates a terrorist, potentially saving hundreds of lives, the ethical implications of public safety should consider these saved lives. This perspective suggests that refraining from using AI weaponry could also act against public safety codes (Arkin, 2010).
				</p>
				<p>
					Alberto's response underscores the initial non-lethal iteration of the product and engineers' concerns about insufficient protections against tampering. This implies that the engineers knowingly designed a system that could be repurposed into a lethal weapon. The potential for misuse of such technology must be considered and minimised, even when the initial intent is non-lethal (Sharkey, 2012).
				</p>
				<p>
					Developing autonomous active response weaponry involves complex ethical, legal, and social implications. Computing professionals are responsible for prioritising public safety, minimising potential misuse, and considering the potential consequences of their work (Horowitz & Scharre, 2015). Ensuring compliance with relevant codes and guidelines, addressing concerns about accountability, and balancing potential harm with benefits are crucial in the ongoing debate surrounding AI-driven weaponry.

					<h2>Seminar 2</h2>

				<h4>Preparation</h4>
				<p>
					<strong>Research Methodology Appropriateness</strong>
					<br>
					Usually, a survey paper like the one from Sun et al. (2020) uses a systematic literature review as its primary research methodology. This is a well-established method for synthesizing the current state of research on a particular topic and is thus typically appropriate for such papers (Kitchenham & Charters, 2007). Beimel and Malkin's (2004) paper, given its theoretical nature in the field of cryptography, likely uses mathematical proofs and analyses, which is also appropriate for the subject matter.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Data Collection and Analysis Appropriateness</strong>
					<br>
					In the survey paper, data collection typically involves collecting and reviewing a large number of relevant research papers and articles. The authors then analyze and categorize the gathered data based on predefined criteria, generally considered suitable for this type of research (Peters et al., 2015). For theoretical papers like Beimel and Malkin's (2004), the data usually comes from established cryptographic theories and principles. The authors then apply mathematical logic and reasoning to analyze this data, which is also considered appropriate.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Support for Claims and Conclusions</strong>
					<br>
					In survey papers, the support for claims and conclusions often comes from the referenced studies. If Sun et al. (2020) have correctly cited relevant studies and accurately represented their findings, then their claims should be well-supported. Similarly, Beimel and Malkin's (2004) support should come from rigorous mathematical proofs. These should be presented and logically follow the stated assumptions and established theories (Goldreich, 2001).
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Enhancing the Work</strong>
					<br>
					Enhancement suggestions are highly context-dependent. However, standard enhancements for survey papers include extending the search strategy to incorporate more diverse sources, including recent publications, or using meta-analysis to provide a more quantitative synthesis of the surveyed studies (Kitchenham & Charters, 2007). For theoretical papers, enhancements could include extending the theoretical model to incorporate more realistic assumptions, providing more intuitive explanations or examples, or considering more diverse theory applications (Wegener, 2000).

				<h4>Research Proposal Review</h4>
				<p>
					For the research method, I suggest using a mixed method approach, which combines quantitative and qualitative methods. This could provide a well-rounded understanding of the topic. The quantitative method could involve analyzing data about the usage of these apps, their impact on response times, and other measurable outcomes. On the other hand, the qualitative aspect could involve exploring user experiences and case studies and examining the challenges and benefits of these apps from a more personal perspective.
				</p>
				<p>
					In terms of data collection methods, surveys and interviews could be particularly useful. Surveys can provide quantitative data about app usage frequency, user satisfaction, and other relevant factors. Interviews with emergency service professionals, app developers, and users can give deeper insights into these apps' effectiveness, strengths and weaknesses, and areas for improvement.
				</p>
				<p>
					Remember that these are initial thoughts and might change as I delve deeper into my research and refine my research question.
