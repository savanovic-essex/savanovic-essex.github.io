				<h4>Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys</h4>
				<p>
					The Cambridge Analytica case is a prime example of how surveys can be misused for unethical purposes. The firm worked with Dr Aleksandr Kogan, a researcher at Cambridge University, who created an app called "thisisyourdigitallife." This app offered a personality quiz to Facebook users, and about 270,000 people downloaded and took it. However, due to Facebook's lax data privacy policies at the time, the app could also harvest data from those users' friends, thus amassing data on an estimated 87 million users, mainly in the US.
				</p>
				<p>
					This data was used to create psychographic profiles to target individuals with highly personalized political ads during the 2016 US presidential election. This raised numerous ethical, social, legal, and professional issues:
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Ethical</strong>: Cambridge Analytica's actions constituted a significant breach of privacy and misused the trust users placed in the survey and Facebook. Data was used in ways that users had not explicitly consented to, manipulating their political opinions.</li>
						<li><strong>Social</strong>: This misuse of data may have affected the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election, thereby profoundly shaping society and politics.</li>
						<li><strong>Legal</strong>: Cambridge Analytica and Facebook faced significant legal repercussions due to these actions. In the UK, the Information Commissioner's Office fined Facebook Â£500,000 for its role in the data scandal. Facebook agreed to pay the Federal Trade Commission a $5 billion fine in the US.</li>
						<li><strong>Professional</strong>: The incident has had long-lasting impacts on how tech companies handle user data and has led to increased scrutiny and regulations in the industry. It also underscores the importance of ethical considerations in data science and digital marketing professions.</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>
					Another example of inappropriate use of surveys can be seen in the case of Strava, a social network for athletes. In 2018, the company released a global heat map showing the activity routes of its users. While this was not a traditional survey, it still involved the collection and use of user data. The heat map unintentionally revealed the locations of military bases and patrol routes, posing a significant security risk. This instance illustrates how seemingly harmless data collection can have profound implications when not properly anonymized or protected, impacting national security and individual privacy.
					<br><br>
					Considering this from various standpoints:
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Ethical</strong>: Strava did not consider the privacy risks of revealing such specific user data. While they didn't intentionally aim to show sensitive locations, the lack of foresight and potential harm to users (military personnel) was a significant ethical lapse.</li>
						<li><strong>Social</strong>: The incident heightened awareness about data privacy and digital footprint. It showed how even benign activities like fitness tracking could inadvertently reveal sensitive information.</li>
						<li><strong>Legal</strong>: While no formal legal action was taken against Strava, the incident highlighted potential legal ramifications for tech companies failing to protect user data adequately.</li>
						<li><strong>Professional</strong>: This incident underlined the need for data privacy measures and considerations to be incorporated into the design and implementation of apps and software, highlighting the responsibility of companies and professionals in the tech industry to ensure user data is handled with care.</li>
					</ol>
