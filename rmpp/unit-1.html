					<h2>Collaborative Discussion 1: Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct</h2>
				</header>
				<h4>Initial post</h4>
				<p>
					In the Automated Active Response Weaponry case study, a defence contractor develops an AI-driven weapon system that autonomously targets and eliminates perceived threats, raising ethical concerns about potential errors and loss of human life. Key issues include the risk of false positives, the moral responsibility of AI developers, and adherence to the ACM Code of Ethics, focusing on public interest, privacy, and security.
				</p>
				<p>
					The ACM Code of Ethics (2018) emphasizes computing professionals' responsibility to act in the public interest (Principle 1). The autonomous defence system's potential to harm innocent people contradicts this principle. Principles 2 (avoid harm) and 3 (be honest and trustworthy) require professionals to consider their work's consequences and accurately communicate potential risks, which need to be addressed in the case study.
				</p>
				<p>
					Legally, autonomous weapons development may fall under international humanitarian law (IHL) and jurisdictional restrictions. The Martens Clause, a fundamental IHL principle, mandates that emerging technologies adhere to principles of humanity and dictates of public conscience (ICRC, n.d.). Computing professionals must consider these legal aspects.
				</p>
				<p>
					Socially, deploying autonomous defence systems can cause public distrust and fear. The ACM Code of Ethics (2018) states in Principle 7 that professionals should be aware of their work's social consequences. Similarly, the BCS Code of Conduct (2022) emphasizes acting in the public interest (Clause 1) and safeguarding stakeholders' interests (Clause 3). The potential for human life loss and ethical concerns surrounding machine-based decision-making in life-or-death situations must be weighed against the technology's benefits.
				</p>
				<p>
					The computing professionals' professionalism is questioned when ethical concerns and potential risks remain unaddressed. Both the ACM Code of Ethics (2018) and the BCS Code of Conduct (2022) stress professional competence (ACM Principle 6, BCS Clause 2) and continuous professional development. Professionals must stay informed about their work's ethical, legal, and social implications and adhere to relevant codes and guidelines.
				</p>
				<p>
					In conclusion, developing autonomous active response weaponry raises significant ethical, legal, and social concerns. ACM and BCS codes of conduct emphasize computing professionals' responsibility to act in the public interest and consider their work's potential consequences. To ensure compliance, professionals must be transparent about risks, continuously learn, and adhere to legal and regulatory frameworks.

					<h2>Reflective activity</h2>

				<h4>Ethics in Computing</h4>
				<p>
					Suppose I am a computing professional working for a software development company that creates digital solutions for healthcare institutions. A central ethical issue in this role would be protecting the privacy and confidentiality of patients' data, a topic likely discussed by Stahl et al. (2016).
				</p>
				<p>
					Stahl et al.'s critique of the state of computing ethics suggests a gap between theory and practice in this domain, emphasizing that many researchers often need to provide actionable advice for stakeholders. This critique suggests the importance of practical ethical considerations in my role and the necessity for interdisciplinary collaboration to bridge the gap between computing and ethics research (Stahl et al., 2016).
				</p>
				<p>
					In addressing this issue, I would advocate for implementing robust data encryption methods, strict access controls, anonymization of data, and regular security audits. These practices align with the concept of privacy by design (Cavoukian, 2010). This approach encourages proactively embedding privacy into the design and operation of IT systems, networks, and business practices.
				</p>
				<p>
					Promoting a culture of data privacy within the company is another critical action, ensuring that all employees understand these practices' importance (Husted, 2010). Regular training sessions and consistent communication help reinforce this culture.
				</p>
				<p>
					These actions could enhance the company's reputation as a responsible handler of sensitive data and contribute to setting industry standards for data privacy and security in healthcare software development. They would ensure compliance with relevant data privacy laws like HIPAA in the U.S., and GDPR in Europe, thereby avoiding legal penalties (Kierkegaard, 2011).
				</p>
				<p>
					Like Bott's (2014) book, professional guidance could offer further insights into IT's professional issues, such as ethical decision-making, regulatory compliance, and social responsibilities.
					With the constant evolution of computing ethics, these actions must be continuously reviewed and updated to respond to new ethical dilemmas, technological advancements, and legal and social norms (Mittelstadt et al., 2016).
