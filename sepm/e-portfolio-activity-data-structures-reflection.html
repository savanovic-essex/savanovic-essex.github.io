				<h4>Data Structures Reflection</h4>
				<p>
					As a social media platform, Instagram involves much data handling and management, which can be achieved through appropriate data structures.
				</p>
				<p>
					One data structure that could be used is a hash table, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of data such as user information and password hashes. Smith et al. (2017) claim that hash tables can be implemented for user authentication and security and for storing information about users' followers, posts, and other details.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another data structure that could be used is a graph, which would help in modelling and managing user relationships. Aksoy et al. (2020) argue that graphs could be used to implement features such as the follow/unfollow functionality, the ability to view a user's followers and following, and recommendation systems.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, Instagram could use a priority queue to manage the newsfeed, where posts are ranked based on factors such as relevance and recency. This would ensure that the most important posts are displayed first to users, enhancing their overall experience on the platform. The paper "Priority Queues for Real-Time Data Processing" by Lee et al. (2019) describes the use of priority queues for real-time data processing and ranking.
				</p>
				<p>
					Trees, such as binary trees and AVL trees, could also be used to store and manage information efficiently, such as hashtags and associated posts. This would allow for efficient search and retrieval of posts based on hashtags and help Instagram efficiently manage the massive amounts of data it handles daily. The use of trees for efficient data storage and recovery is described in the paper "Data Structures and Algorithms for Tree-Based Information Management" by Chen et al. (2018).
				</p>
				<p>
					In conclusion, various data structures, such as hash tables, graphs, priority queues, and trees, can play a significant role in the back-end operations of Instagram, helping the platform to efficiently store, retrieve, and manage the large amounts of data it handles. These findings align with the results presented in the papers cited above, which highlight the importance of using appropriate data structures for efficient data management in large-scale applications.
