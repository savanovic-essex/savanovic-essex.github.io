				<h4>Reflection on Software Quality</h4>
				<p>
					To measure software quality, it is always good to consider the capability maturity model as one of the essential quality models of software quality maintenance. Software quality consists of three aspects: functional, process, and structural. McCall, Richards, and Walters published in 1977 published an article entitled, "Factors in software quality, concepts and definitions of quality features. Overall, the book discussed several features that were seen to determine software quality. These qualities discussed included: functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability, and portability, as seen in the article. The authors focused on the concept of quality assurance, the development process, and the need for continuous improvement.
				</p>
				<p>
					More new articles on quality software have been introduced, and the new one which can be compared with the other from 1977 is A systematic review on software quality models" by Raza et al. (2015). The authors of the article propose four categories of models: ISO/IEC standards, software engineering standards, specific models, and integrated models, as discussed (Capretz et al., 2015). Several factors compare the article of McCall with that of Raza. One of their differences relates to the scope of the examination. McCall focuses on functionality, reliability, usability and efficiency as the main factors affecting software quality and proposes a framework; later on, Raza conducted a systematic review of software quality models proposed in the literature over 15 years and grouped them into four categories which evaluate general and specific software products. Another difference in the article is the advanced level of engineering. In contrast, the article of 1977 was written when software engineering had fewer models, unlike the article of Raza, which shows more advanced fields having more models and frameworks. The ISO model considers six factors proposed to overcome confusing software quality models.
				</p>
				<p>
					In conclusion, although both articles show valuable insights into concept software quality, they differ in their focus and offer different perspectives. To determine the quality of the software, we consider its development. Software qualities developed during the 1990s became outdated due to industrial development. It can be simple for the developer to cross-check both development and quality in mind.
