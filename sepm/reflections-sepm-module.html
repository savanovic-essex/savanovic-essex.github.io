				<h4>Reflections on the Software Engineering Project Management Module</h4>
				<p>
					The Software Engineering Project Management subject was a valuable learning experience that allowed me to gain various skills and knowledge useful in my current and future career as an app developer. Through my contributions to team activities, experience as a development team member, and exposure to new libraries and automation tools, I developed technical and soft skills essential for success in the software engineering industry.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a development team member, I was part of a project to develop a child's toy using the Pygame library. Our team was responsible for different aspects of the project, including writing the project management document, designing the menus, car steering, and overall graphics. This experience taught me the importance of clear communication and efficient time management in ensuring project success. I also gained hands-on experience in project planning and management, which will be helpful in my future professional endeavours. Additionally, I learned how to create timelines effectively, set milestones, and track progress. This experience was beneficial, as project management is an essential skill in the IT industry, regardless of its scope. Effective project management ensures that projects are completed on time and within budget, which is vital in meeting customer needs and ensuring project success. According to a study by Rahman and Bhuiyan (2019), effective project management is critical to software engineering success and can lead to improved productivity, better quality, and increased customer satisfaction.
				</p>
				<p>
					Being a part of this group allowed me to develop my collaboration and communication skills further. Having a proper senior engineer as a group partner was also rather lovely, meaning I could learn from somebody with more experience in project management and software engineering than me. Working in a team setting necessitates excellent communication and teamwork to ensure everyone is on the same page and pursuing the same objectives. According to Bui (2020), soft skills such as collaboration and communication are essential for success in any workplace. They allow individuals to work effectively in teams and build strong relationships with colleagues. I developed these skills through my experience in the Software Engineering Project Management module, which will be valuable in any team-based environment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unquestionably, there were minor problems in communication, especially considering that we were in different time zones. At the beginning of the project, some minor disagreements arose, but fortunately, we managed to handle them gracefully and accept everybody's opinion. Ultimately, we had to rely on asynchronous communication through Slack, but it worked fine. In retrospect, it has been a valuable and fulfilling experience for me professionally and personally. On a personal level, I understood the value of teamwork, being open to feedback, and being adaptive. On a professional level, I gained valuable experience in software development and project management, which will be invaluable in my ongoing career.
				</p>
				<p>
					Furthermore, working with the Pygame library and automation tools allowed me to develop my technical skills in software engineering. Pygame is a popular library for developing games and interactive applications in Python, and learning to use it effectively could be valuable for my future development projects. Even though Python or any of its libraries are not my main focus, they could become one later. Automation tools like GitHub Actions were also beneficial for speeding up development and ensuring that our code was always working as expected. This part of the project might be the most advantageous for me, as up until now, I have had minimal experience with DevOps, even at a rudimentary level. According to Shah and Balasubramanian (2019), automation tools can be valuable for software development projects, as they allow developers to speed up development and reduce the likelihood of errors. This experience allowed me to understand the software engineering development process better and develop my technical skills.
				</p>
				<p>
					The impact of this experience on my professional and personal development has been significant. As an app developer, I am now better equipped to work in software engineering teams, manage projects effectively, and develop high-quality applications. These skills are essential for success in the software engineering industry and will make me a more attractive candidate for future job opportunities. It will also be beneficial if I start my own company, where I will have to do more management and not rely on project or product managers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, the soft skills I developed through my experience in the course, such as collaboration and communication, will be valuable in any team-based environment, including outside of software engineering. For example, according to Royce (1998), clear communication and efficient time management are critical success factors in software development projects. He argues that a lack of clear communication can lead to misunderstandings and delays, while poor time management can result in missed deadlines and budget overruns. By participating in this project, I could apply these principles in practice and gain a deeper understanding of their importance.
				</p>
				<p>
					Overall, the Software Engineering Project Management module was a valuable experience that allowed me to gain various skills and knowledge that will be useful in my future career. Through my contributions to team activities, experience as a development team member, and exposure to new libraries and automation tools, I developed technical and soft skills essential for success in the software engineering industry. By reflecting on my experience, I could identify the key insights and learnings from the course and plan for future development opportunities.
				</p>
				<p>
					In summary, my experience in the Software Engineering Project Management module has been valuable and enriching, both professionally and personally. I am happy to have participated in this module since the knowledge and abilities I received will be helpful in my future endeavours. This will allow me to plan for future development opportunities and continue growing and developing my project management and software engineering skills.
