					<h2>Collaborative Discussion 2: Scanning Exercise and Results</h2>
				</header>
				<h4>Initial post</h4>
				<p>
					The Components of User Experience (CUE) model by Thüring and Mahlke (2007) describes the three main components of user experience as:
					<ol>
						<li>Sensory experience refers to the user's perception of the product through the senses.</li>
						<li>Affective experience refers to the user's emotional response to the product.</li>
						<li>Behavioural experience refers to the user's actions and interactions with the product.</li>
					</ol>
					In response to changing human emotions over time, one might consider adapting the CUE model in multiple ways, based on the inclusion of the satisfaction factor.
				</p>
				<p>
					Incorporating real-time emotional measurement: As emotions are dynamic and can change rapidly in response to different stimuli, designers might consider incorporating real-time monitoring of users' emotional states to adapt the sensory, affective, and behavioural components of the CUE model in real-time. This might involve incorporating physiological sensors to measure emotions or using machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns in user behaviour and infer emotional states (Picard, 1997).
				</p>
				<p>
					Designing for emotional engagement: With the rise of virtual and augmented reality, designers might consider incorporating these technologies to create more immersive and emotionally engaging experiences. For example, VR and AR could be used to create simulations that evoke strong emotions, or to enhance sensory experiences through the use of haptic feedback (Blythe et al., 2003).
				</p>
				<p>
					Accounting for emotions in the context of use: As emotions are context-dependent, designers might consider incorporating contextual information into their designs to create experiences that are more tailored to the users' emotional states. This might involve using geolocation data or tracking the users' daily routines to create more contextually relevant experiences (Hassenzahl et al., 2010).
				</p>
				<p>
					In conclusion, if a user has even a basic satisfaction after the usage of the product, they will repeat the usage, which will allow for tracking and better optimisation of the UI itself. Important to remember is that no user is the same in perpetuity, meaning their needs and context will change and only proper tracking will allow for correct adjustments in the system.

				<h4>Peer Response from Marianne Manaog</h4>
				<p>
					Hi Djordje,
					<br>
					Thank you for highlighting how there are various components of the user experience, considering both tangible (sensory) and intangible (affective and behavioural) elements. Furthermore, I agree that it is key to design for emotional engagement and quantifying it, as something cannot be improved unless it is measured indeed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Inspired by the more holistic and recent work of Zhao & Bacao (2020), as per the figure I adapted as below, I would suggest you capturing the key expectancies of users regarding both effort and subsequent performance, as well key contextual details, such as the organisational intentions, individual and collective trust, as well as the social influence exerted on the users towards leveraging a specific system. Furthermore, the key perception of the fit of the technology with respect to the task or job to be done (JTBD) (Zhao & Bacao, 2020) should also be accounted for, which typically is fundamental to ensure a smooth user experience and adoption. As you also captured in your diagram, the system’s experience and perceived value on users will ultimately result in either satisfaction or dissatisfaction, thus leading to continuance or discontinuance respectively (Zhao & Bacao, 2020).
				</p>

					I hope this helps.

					Best wishes,

				<h4>Summary Post</h4>
				<p>
					The user experience (UX) is a critical element in determining the success or failure of a product.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Components of User Experience (CUE) model, proposed by Thüring and Mahlke (2007), identifies three key components of user experience: sensory, affective, and behavioural (Thüring & Mahlke, 2007).
				</p>
				<p>
					Marianne suggests adapting the CUE model by capturing users' key expectancies of both effort, and subsequent performance and key contextual details, such as the organizational intentions, trust, and social influence exerted on users. Furthermore, the fit of the technology with the task or job to be done should be accounted for, as this is fundamental to ensure a smooth user experience and adoption. Zhao and Bacao (2020) also suggest that the system's experience and perceived value on users will ultimately result in either satisfaction or dissatisfaction, leading to continuance or discontinuance, respectively.

					Designers might consider incorporating real-time emotional measurement by using physiological sensors to measure emotions or using machine learning algorithms to analyse patterns in user behaviour and infer emotional states (Picard, 1997). Designing for emotional engagement through virtual and augmented reality could also create more immersive and emotionally engaging experiences (Blythe et al., 2003). Finally, incorporating contextual information into designs to create experiences more tailored to the users' emotional states may involve geolocation data or tracking users' daily routines (Hassenzahl et al., 2010).
				</p>
				<p>
					Proper tracking is essential to adjust the system correctly, as no user is the same in perpetuity, and their needs and context will change (Zhao & Bacao, 2020). Incorporating these changes will lead to a better user experience, resulting in satisfaction and, thus, repeat product usage.
