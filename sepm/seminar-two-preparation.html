				<h4>Activity One</h4>
				<p>
					The NIST Privacy Framework provides a framework for organizations to manage privacy risk. It is not directly tied to specific risk assessment methods and tools but can be used with various risk assessment methods and tools.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, "Mythical Man Month" by Brooks (1975) is a classic software engineering book that discusses the challenges of managing software projects, including the difficulty of estimating the time and resources required for a project. The NIST Privacy Framework can identify privacy risks associated with software projects and ensure that privacy considerations are taken into account in project planning and management.
				</p>
				<p>
					The "Constructive Cost Model" by Boehm (1981) is a software cost estimation model that uses historical data and expert judgement to estimate the cost of software projects. The NIST Privacy Framework can identify privacy risks associated with software projects and ensure that privacy considerations are taken into account in cost estimation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The "Function Points" by Albrecht (1979) is a software size measure used in software cost estimation. The NIST Privacy Framework can identify privacy risks associated with software projects and ensure that privacy considerations are taken into account in function point analysis.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Planning Poker" by Grenning (2002) is a technique used in agile software development to estimate the effort required for tasks. The NIST Privacy Framework can be used to identify privacy risks associated with software development tasks and to ensure that privacy considerations are taken into account in planning poker.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Expert Judgement" by Jorgensen & Shepperd (2007) is a method for eliciting expert opinions for software cost estimation. The NIST Privacy Framework can identify privacy risks associated with software projects and ensure that privacy considerations are taken into account in expert judgement.
				</p>
				<p>
					In general, the NIST Privacy Framework can be used with various risk assessment methods and tools to help organizations manage privacy risk comprehensively and systematically.
				</p>

				<h4>Activity Two</h4>
				<p>
					In the article "Risks and risk mitigation in global software development: A tertiary study" by Verner et al. (2014), the authors identify several main risks in global software development, including:
					<ol>
						<li>
							Communication risks: The lack of face-to-face communication and cultural differences can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunication between team members.
						</li>
						<li>
							Schedule and budget risks: Delays and cost overruns are common in global software development projects due to the complexity of coordinating work across multiple locations.
						</li>
						<li>
							Quality risks: Quality control can be challenging in global software development projects due to work processes, tools, and standards differences.
						</li>
						<li>
							Security risks: Data security can be a concern in global software development projects due to the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information.
						</li>
						<li>
							Human resource risks: Attracting and retaining talented personnel can be challenging in global software development projects.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>
					The authors also discuss strategies for mitigating these risks, including establishing clear project goals, effective communication and collaboration, and using appropriate tools and processes. <br/>
					In the article "Enterprise Risk Management: A Literature Review and Agenda for Future Research" by Anton & Nucu (2020), the authors review the existing literature on Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and identify several main risks facing organizations, including:
					<ol>
						<li>
							Strategic risks: The risk of making poor strategic decisions that harm the organization.
						</li>
						<li>
							Operational risks: The risk of disruptions to normal business operations due to factors such as natural disasters, cyberattacks, or supply chain disruptions.
						</li>
						<li>
							Financial risks: The risk of financial losses due to market volatility, currency fluctuations, or changes in interest rates.
						</li>
						<li>
							Reputational risks: The risk of damage to an organization's reputation due to negative publicity or a loss of trust from stakeholders.
						</li>
						<li>
							Compliance risks: The risk of non-compliance with laws, regulations, and standards, which can result in fines, legal action, or loss of reputation.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>
					The authors also suggest areas for future research in the field of ERM, including developing new methods and tools for managing risk, integrating ERM into decision-making processes, and the role of technology in ERM.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<p>
					The most appropriate for capturing and categorizing the risks identified in the articles by Verner et al. (2014) and Anton & Nucu (2020) would be:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Gantt chart: A Gantt chart is a visual representation of a project schedule that shows each task's start and end dates and any dependencies between tasks. This helps identify potential risks to the project schedule, such as delays or resource constraints.
						</li>
						<li>
							Critical Path Method (CPM): The Critical Path Method is a project management technique that uses a network diagram to identify the critical path in a project. The critical path is the sequence of tasks that determines the minimum duration of the project, and any delay to a task on the critical path will delay the entire project. This can help identify potential project timelines risks, such as resource constraints or delays in task completion.
						</li>
						<li>
							Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM): Critical Chain Project Management is a project management technique that focuses on managing the resources and constraints in a project rather than just the individual tasks. CCPM uses buffer management and resource levelling to mitigate the risk of delays and improve the project schedule.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					The other frameworks discussed in the Unit 3 lecturecast are similar to the Critical Path Method but with a slightly different approach to project management.<br>
					All of these frameworks can be useful for identifying and mitigating risks in a project, and the choice of the framework will depend on the specific needs and goals of the project.
