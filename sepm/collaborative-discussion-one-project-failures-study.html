					<h2>Collaborative Discussion 1: Project Failures Study</h2>
				</header>
				<h4>Initial post</h4>
				<p>
					Question 1: What do you believe are the three most common reasons for project failure? <br />
					<br />
					<strong>Project complexity:</strong> In software product companies, the projects are related to maintaining and improving the existing product. Over the years, the existing product grows, increasing the complexity of both the product and the project tasks. This leads to an increasing need for instructions & experience, values & responsibilities, cooperation, resources & schedules, and improved work practices (Lehtinen et al., 2014).
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Software testing:</strong> The lack of software testing and a proper strategy for conducting the aforementioned test, can push back a software project release immensely, or even worse, it can cause life-altering problems in the production. Additionally, when upgrading a legacy system to a new one, it is important to ensure the testing coverage has not been decreased and hence opened the project to a potential failure.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Social interaction:</strong> Insufficient and unclear communication can lead to incorrect interpretation of requirements, which ultimately leads to project problems, if not a project failure. Inter-department support and cooperation is quintessential to a successful project management, especially in case of internal stakeholders. May (1998) claims that stakeholder conflicts and breakdowns in communication are common causes of failures. Egorova et al. (2010) present that team spirit have a significant impact to the success of software projects. Verner et al. (2008) present that if the staff is not rewarded for working long hours, their motivation decreases, resulting in increasing risk for failures.
				</p>
				<p>
					Question 2: Give two examples of failures that support your choices <br />
					<br />
					<strong>Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS):</strong> The U.S. Air Force has decided to scrap a major ERP (enterprise resource planning) software project after spending US$1 billion, concluding that finishing it would cost far too much more money for too little gain (Kanaracus, 2012). Prior to ECSS’s inception, the Air Force did not adequately plan for its acquisition. Instead, the Air Force had only an idea of what capability it wanted ECSS to deliver: a new, fully-integrated logistics system that would replace an unspecified number of older, unconnected logistics systems. The Air Force failed in its procurement of the Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS) between 2004 and 2012, because it lacked a clear objective and the organizational will to implement changes to its internal business processes vital to integrating ECSS into the organization (Levin & McCain, 2014).
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>AT&T Switch Failure:</strong> At 2:25pm on Monday, January 15th, network managers at AT&T's Network Operations Center in Bedminster, N.J. began noticing an alarming number of red warning signals from various parts of their world-wide network. New York switch began to distribute the signals that had backed up during the time it was off-line. Across the country, another switch received a message that a call from New York was on its way, and began to update its records to show the New York switch back online. A second message from the New York switch then arrived, lass than ten milliseconds after the first. Because the first message had not yet been handled, the second message should have been saved until later. A software defect then caused the second message to be written over crucial communications information. When the second switch recovered, it began to route it's backlogged calls, and propagated the cycle of close-timed messages and shut-downs throughout the network. The problem repeated iteratively throughout the 114 switches in the network, blocking over 50 million calls in the nine hours it took to stabilize the system (Calpoly.edu, 2022).

				<h4>Peer Response to Alberto Rossotto</h4>
				<p>
					Dear Alberto,
					<br>
					Thank you for this insightful essay! I agree with your argument that while technical errors may seem like the cause of failure in IT projects, they are often symptoms of deeper issues such as poor business decisions, staffing issues, lack of knowledge, and complexity. It is essential to look beyond the technical explanation of the failure to identify the underlying causes. Similar reasons caused the blackout in the Northeastern United States in 2003.
				</p>
				<p>
					On August 14, 2003, a significant power outage affected more than 50 million people in the Northeastern United States and some areas of Canada. The blackout was caused by a technical failure that began with a power line in Ohio overloading and tripping, cascading into other parts of the grid, causing a widespread blackout.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, the root causes of the blackout went beyond the technical issues. According to a report by the U.S.-Canada Power System Outage Task Force (2004), the blackout was also due to inadequate system design and operational practices, poor communication and coordination between grid operators, and insufficient investment in the electrical grid infrastructure.
				</p>
				<p>
					In particular, the report found that insufficient investment in the grid led to ageing and fragile equipment being more prone to failure. In addition, the lack of communication and coordination between grid operators resulted in a lack of situational awareness and made it difficult for them to respond effectively to the crisis.
				</p>
				<p>
					The blackout of 2003 serves as a reminder that technical failures can have far-reaching consequences and that it is essential to address both technical and non-technical factors to ensure the reliability and stability of critical infrastructure.

				<h4>Summary Post</h4>
				<p>
					Project complexity can occur when an existing product begins to grow and expand. This leads to an increase in complexity not only for the product itself but also for the tasks associated with the project. To manage this complexity, there is a higher requirement for coordination and the adoption of better work methods. However, software testing must be performed, and a proper strategy must be in place, or else the release of the software project can be delayed or result in problems during production.
				</p>
				<p>
					An example of a project failure that supports the first reason, project complexity, is the London Ambulance Service's control room project. This project aimed to upgrade the existing ambulance dispatch system and control room processes, but it was initially plagued with problems. The project needed to be simpler for the current technology infrastructure, and the contractors must have underestimated the work required to integrate the new system into the existing processes (Bowerman & Smith, 2007). The result was a system that could not process calls on time, leading to significant delays in the dispatch of ambulances and risking patient lives (Bowerman & Smith, 2007).
				</p>
				<p>
					The second example of a project failure that supports the second reason, software testing, is the Millennium Bridge in London. The bridge was intended to be a signature landmark and was opened to the public in 2000. However, on its opening day, it was closed due to excessive wobbling and swaying, which was caused by an unexpected interaction between the bridge's design and the way people walked on it (Gourley & Howells, 2002). The engineers did not adequately test the bridge's response to the movement of large crowds, so the bridge was closed for two years for safety upgrades (Gourley & Howells, 2002).
				</p>
				<p>
					In conclusion, project complexity, lack of software testing, inadequate communication and coordination, and lack of motivation can all lead to project failures. The case studies of the London Ambulance Service's control room project and the Millennium Bridge in London highlight the importance of simplifying the project, adequately testing the software, and improving communication and teamwork in order to ensure project success. Organizations need to be aware of these potential obstacles and take preventative action to minimize their effects. This includes having a clear project strategy, investing in software testing, fostering a positive work environment, and rewarding staff for their hard work.
